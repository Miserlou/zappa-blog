## Oh snap!

Did you guys know that Amazon actually sells stuff besides web servers?

For instance.. Zappa T-Shirts!

They're available in Men's and Women's cuts and in 5 different colors!

Available in both [Django](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZRKCWW?th=1) and [Flask](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0742TBVN2) variants.

Enjoy!

Rich
