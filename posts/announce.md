I've said it many times now: _Zappa needs a blog!_

Well, I finally got round to throwing one together.

It's not much for now, but it'll do for hosting announcements and tutorials that don't belong in the already over-grown README file.

It's powered by a hacked-up version of [Zappa-CMS](https://github.com/Miserlou/zappa-cms), which is a fun and easy way to make a server-less CMS that's only powered by Markdown.

Want to write a blog post, tutorial, or announcement about Zappa? Let me know, or just submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Miserlou/zappa-blog)!

Happy hacking!,

Rich
