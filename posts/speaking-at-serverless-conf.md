Exciting news!

I'm going to be speaking about Zappa at two conferences coming up soon: [ServerlessConf](http://serverlessconf.io/) in London and [Nordic APIs](http://nordicapis.com/) in Stockholm!

My talk in Stockholm will be about building server-less APIs, and my talk at ServerlessConf will be about building globally available server-less architectures!

I'll also be announcing some awesome new features that are going to be landing in Zappa soon!

If you're going to be going to at either at these conferences, please come and find me and let's have a chat!

Thanks!

Rich
