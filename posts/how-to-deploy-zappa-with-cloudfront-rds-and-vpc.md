Quick link!

Zappa contributor [Brian Jinwright](https://jinwright.net) has written an awesome tutorial/brain dump on how he deploys CDN'd Zappa applications.

Check it out here: [How to Deploy a Serverless WSGI App using Zappa, CloudFront, RDS, and VPC](https://jinwright.net/how-deploy-serverless-wsgi-app-using-zappa/).

Thanks, Brian!
